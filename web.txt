How does the internet work? 

The internet is filles with servers and networks that can communicate with each other.
to communicate with each other you send requests through the unique IP adress. 

What happens when you click a link?

When you click a link your browser(in my case chrome) sends a request to that URL 
that's in the link. Then the link has a hostname that's connect to the IP address.
Then finally you are redirected to that IP address that will be seen as a name such as
youtube.
